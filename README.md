# MyRepository

Hi, nice to meet you.

My name is Alan, I'm a Data Engineer currently working for Teracloud as of July 2023, working mainly with AWS building infrastructure, data pipelines and DataOps.

I've had previous experiences working as a Data Scientist, reason why some of my projects are python notebooks.
